# Real-Time-Webcam-Video-Processing-with-OpenCV
This repository contains Python code that demonstrates real-time webcam video processing using OpenCV, a popular computer vision library. The code captures frames from the webcam, allows the user to add rectangles to the frame, and displays the modified frame with the added rectangles. The rectangles are positioned based on the available space in the frame, and their coordinates are calculated using the provided dimensions and gap values.
### 1. Prerequisites
* Python installed on your machine
* OpenCV library installed (pip install opencv-python)
### 2. Usage
# 1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
# 2. Open the script file, Real-Time-Webcam-Video-Processing-with-OpenCV.py, in a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice.
# 3. Make sure you have a webcam connected to your machine.

### 1. Features:
* Real-time video processing from the webcam
* Adding rectangles to the frame
* Automatic positioning of rectangles based on available space
* Keyboard input for user interaction
* Modular functions for drawing rectangles and calculating positions
### 2. Potential Applications:
* Object detection: Modify the code to perform real-time object detection using pre-trained models like YOLO or SSD.
* Face detection and recognition: Integrate face detection and recognition algorithms for identification and personalized experiences.
* Augmented Reality (AR): Overlay virtual objects or effects onto the webcam feed for interactive AR experiences.
* Pose estimation: Detect and track human poses in real-time, visualizing joints or providing visual feedback.
* Motion detection and tracking: Track moving objects by comparing consecutive frames, visualizing them with rectangles.
* Gesture recognition: Recognize hand gestures in real-time, visualizing them or providing user feedback.
* Human-Computer Interaction: Create interactive systems where user actions or gestures control applications or games.
